For example when her pairs feel better about jQuery, she was onboard with that since she is comfortable with HTML/CSS. She felt she probably looked lost in pairing.

He is also not absorbing directions or recommendations causing him to ask the same questions repeatedly.

The first issue was obvious to me (he doesn't understand how code runs on a line-by-line basis), but I decided to focus on his second question. He said he didn't think his code would run in the browser; I had him do it, and it didn't work (as I expected). He read the error message (require is not defined), but didn't seem to digest it all. i had to tell him to focus on the `require` variable, and he did a little Googleing.. I pointed him to the Getting Started guide on nodejs.org. I told him `require()` is from Node, and that he needs to run his code with Node. He Googled ""how to run code with Node""; I opted to just tell him the answer (run `node filename`). This took a couple of minutes because he was in the wrong directory. When he ran it, he said ""it's not working"" because there was no terminal output. I asked, ""what did you expect to see in the terminal output to know whether the file ran correctly?"" He said he expected to see the number of words. I asked: ""what code do you have that outputs the number of words?"" He tried to point to a couple of random lines of code, but I said I didn't agree. Ultimately, he discovered that he didn't write any function invocations. He started to work on invoking getTotalWordCount(), but it was still a big struggle, and we were already 20-25 minutes into the session. I had him pause and asked him to recap the meeting thus far and how he planned on proceeding, given that we'd need to wrap up soon. I had to rephase my question multiple times (bc he said ""the recap of the meeting is that I don't know what's going on, and you're helping me""), and eventually landed on ""what are the takeaways you learned?"" He said he learned how to run his code with node (which I agreed with). I told him that another takeaway should be ""read error messages.""

At the time of the call, he had implemented most of the app functionality but was stuck on the part where the repo list was supposed to update without hitting the refresh button. I spent a lot of time having him start with the client-side search post req and then take me through the steps of the entire process from the search through the updating and posting of the top 25 repos repos. So the problem was that a get req to the db was not happening within the search method directly after the post req was completed. Refactoring to use .then() blocks throughout the refactor really helped  him solidify his understanding of what exactly the post/get reqs were doing, why they happen in that specific order, and how all of that combined with the placement of requests would cause the repos to immediately render. Flagging as yellow rather than red because he has improved a lot with his understanding since I last spoke with him, but there were a few fundamental concepts he did not understand, particularly how the server side code knows that the client sent a request.

The logical interpretation of what they were trying to do was correct. The details of the implementation consisted of iterating over the tree and recursively calling contains or returning false. The missing step was passing the recursive call to contains into a conditional and returning true. They mistakenly believed if the inner recursive call returned true that it would climb up the execution context and return from the initial call. 

I gave the example of evaluating the recursive function and putting the result in place of the call in the editor. ""true"" on a line by itself wouldn't make much sense. This helped solidify the understanding a lot and they were able to solve from there.

I've found a few things helpful: 1. Taking deep, slow breaths to slow my heart rate, and do a ""body scan"" of sorts 2. Acknowledging that I'm nervous and accepting that (I like to think of it like greeting guests at a classy dinner party. Greet them, and let them go on about their business) 3. Re-focusing on the problem and boiling it down into the simplest part(s) 4. Find the simplest piece of the problem to ""solve"" and build from there. 5. Be proud of what you accomplished, even if it's just having the self-awareness to try and improve.
Other tip: Drawing or writing things out AND saying my thoughts out loud also help a lot with focus.
Frankly, I've found all that nervous energy can be re-purposed and quite useful. The difference between feeling nervous and excited is very small.
Hopefully that helps!

Quote: ""As far as what I need to work on, the main feedback that I've received is that I have a tendency to railroad if I am too excited about a potential solution that I see, I believe that I tend to have a hard time jumping in to the mind of my pair partner.

One other small thing that I have received feedback on, unrelated to communication: I have a tendency to want to jump straight into writing code before doing the basic engineering principles of examining the problem""

I gave him the following tips:
""The biggest tip I can make is to ask questions. Even suggesting an idea can be turned into something more collaborative with re-phrasing:
What do you think about doing xyz?
Do you think there's another way to do it?
-state idea- does that make sense? -> this will often lead to a better idea, or drawing and explaining it further
Relatively simple (not always easy), but questions invite your partner to speak up. It makes it more difficult to unintentionally steamroll.
Bonus: if your partner is fairly quiet relative to you, ease up on suggesting ideas, and try to draw out theirs. ""How do you think we should do this?""...then if you have an idea...""what do you think about xyz?"" or concern ""how/would this account for xyz?""""

We took a look at the entrypoint (which was an empty js file), and she noted that nothing was there and was curious if webpack would run.

I had her run the webpack script again, and it ran. Explained that webpack doesn't really care that the file was empty.

She then wasn't quite sure where to proceed, so I had her look at the cowlist readme. She thought she should start on the back-end, and opened her server/index.js file.

It was a file that combined express setup and mysql setup.

Not far along. HD request was in regards to connecting his database to the application. Wasn't sure how to run a js file via the terminal.

Had him take a look at the start script in package.json. It seemed to click after that.

He had already created a DB & schema via MySQL CLI.

Had a file for connecting the db, but didn't know how to run it, and wasn't sure what the code was doing (he admitted to looking at a medium article). Had him run the file (this is where I had to show him how to do that), and discovered the mysql package wasn't installed.

After we installed it, it worked...so there's that.

Then tried to break down the problem of sending and receiving data via requests. He knew enough to use postman, and I recommended that he build a dead simple express server later tonight to practice.

He wasn't sure how to use the db.js file he had created, so I explained requiring files & module.exports, with a quick file we made.

He felt like he hadn't made enough progress, so I asked him what his problem solving process was. He said ""I don't think I have one.""

The issue was the misunderstanding that setState is a synchronous function. Once, I asked her if it was sync vs async, and had her look up documentation, the solution was fairly fluid.

I mentioned that due to time we could go with chaining requests for now, but I encouraged her to later look at if she could consolidate this down to 1 request.

The good: She had a good attitude, and seems to be improving on problem solving. I had to give her a few hints or rec she try something to give her a nudge, but after that she handled it.

I do not think he has a solid understanding of the routing so far — he seemed like he was still lost after we finished the call, even though I suggested: lean on your team mates, try proxy middleware, search google how to implement a proxy WITHOUT middleware.

He expressed that even though his team is doing daily Standups, they do not communicate very much and he wished they talked and shared more information.

Aziz had an issue where his server was logging repeated GET requests for a file that had been removed from the codebase (Jason's codebase). I asked if Aziz had pulled all changes & rebuilt the bundles. He had done both, in addition to deleting the bundles entirely and rebuilding, as well as searching all files for the name of the file in the GET request. 

I was stumped, so this is where Shraya and Danica joined. We helped Aziz identify an issue in his proxy server as well where he was using ""/*"" as an endpoint with the idea that this would somehow help him render different data for different IDs in the URL. I steered him in the right direction and advised that he should use URL parameters instead to capture the ID number and then handle it as needed, and informed him and Jason that they would need to work as a team to decide how to handle their endpoints in a consistent way so that all proxy servers will work with each service correctly.

Aziz then also had questions about AWS deployment. He was starting to deploy his server and had launched an instance but didn't know where to go from there. I advised him that it would be much like setting up the codebase on a new computer only using the terminal and no mouse/screen.

Jeff had started diving into React Router to try and handle different product ids.

Long story short...for starters...his webpack bundle was not working appropriately. I think his browser was caching it, we couldn't get new console logs to work, and even renaming the bundle so it wouldn't ""exist"" didn't work. 

What did work was restarting his computer.

Then had a prolonged conversation about how he could get the information. 

He couldn't think of any methods, so I had him look up string methods, and then explained that he really needed to be able to serve up his html file at the endpoint he was expecting it to render at.

Right now, Jeff is in Jeff's way. He will ask a question, but only sometimes listen to what the SEIR is saying...which usually means A LOT of wasted time trying to refocus his attention, revert a change, or correct his thinking.

Most poignant example: When looking at string methods, he said he didn't know any (which I doubt), so I asked him to briefly look at the page on MDN. None jumped out to him as useful (ok). So, I asked, what about slice? ""No, that won't work, I need to know the start and end index"" I asked in a very *hint hint tone*, ""are you sure?"" ""Yes."" Again, ""are you sure? Let's look at the docs"" I've only used substring for these kinds of things."" (conflicting the 'complete idk answer earlier). I told him he could also use substring, but to take a look at slice as well. Which, I don't think he really did.

Totally fine to use substring instead, but the rigidity even when challenged was a bit baffling.

He wanted to revert from his changes prior to React Router, and said ""I remember all the changes I made""...I recommended he revert to a previous commit instead, and he immediately did a git pull to bring back everything from github. Fortunately it worked out, but...it falls in line with Jeff half-listening and just doing things.

These were likely not the only instances of a lack of listening skills, but they stood out to me. My concern for him moving forward is that his thinking is very rigid, and while he's smart, coachability is an issue.",Red,,,

Andrew seemed despondent about his data generation script. I made him walk through the api calls and the front end code to tell us what the client is expecting from the server. He seemed to not want to take my advice to map out what the shape of his data is.

He also commented that one of his team members is ""not responding"", one ""doesn't know how to help"", and one is ""stuck on the same issue"". I told him to try to lean on his team mates for this project, and to also offer his own help as he discovers more.

He seemed daunted by the amount of data that he needed to include for each product from his DB, so I suggested drawing / writing out exactly what each product needs. He did not seem to want to do this in front of me. 

He also seemed hopeless about the fact that he needed to generate data for 2 different databases. Right now he only has one script for generating. He mentioned that his script was split between 4 parts so he could generate the data without overflowing on memory, and he brought up drains, which I agreed on using.

When I hopped on, she was talking about connecting to PSQL remotely and seemed very confused on the difference between working locally and working with a deployed instance. I asked her if she was working on an AWS instance, and she said yes. This confused me because it seemed like she was stressed about the next deliverable, which does not involve deployment. I mentioned that she should be working locally right now, and she said she thought she was (which contradicted her answer to my question as to whether she was working in an instance). Overall she just seems very flustered and confused about what she's doing, and it seems like it is very difficult for her to communicate her thoughts.

We discusses the pros and cons as well as the specific use cases where caches would improve metrics.

YELLOW because he was also having an issue where his proxy stress tests were significantly slower than expected. I realized he was stress testing his proxy instance using Artillery from within that same instance. I asked him about this choice, and we chatted about how this was using more of his instance memory resources unnecessarily, and I directed him to use Loader for his stress testing to see if his proxy metrics would improve and be within the range he initially expected. He said he was having trouble using Loader with the limitations of the free account, so gave him some workaround tips.

Overall though he has a good mental model of how each piece of his system should relate to other pieces, which instances certain pieces should live on & what the overall hierarchy should look like. He's making good progress.",Yellow,,,
